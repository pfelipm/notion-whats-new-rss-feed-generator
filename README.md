# An RSS feed generator for Notion's releases

```
As of 30/07/22, the Notion Release Notes webpage is generated dynamically,
which renders this script useless as Cheerio can't parse dynamic contents.
Some relevant text content can still be extracted using Cheerio, but I guess
that adapting this script or using a more complex solution (Puppeteer, etc.)
probably is not worth the hassle.

End of story.

Working again on 01/08/22! ðŸ˜§

This is a rather crude attempt at an Apps Script webapp that scrapes [Notion's release page](https://www.notion.so/releases) and generates an RSS feed that contains the most recently published updates. It uses the [Cheerio library](1ReeQ6WO8kKNxoaA_O0XEQ589cIrRvEBA9qcWpNqdOP17i47u6N9M5Xh0) for Apps Script. Please, bear in mind that this thing was just a quick hack to play a little bit with Cheerio and can break anytime. You can either make a copy of the provided codebase and deploy your own webapp or simply use the URL of this pre-deployed instance to add the RSS feed to your newsreader:
